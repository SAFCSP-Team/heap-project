# Heap project

### Objective
The project's main focus is on understanding the heap data structure.

### Problem
Create a min-heap class to store the following integer values [50, 42, 98, 20, 30].

### Implementation
- Create a min-heap class of integers called `MinHeap` with the following operations: `insert()`, `delete()`, `peek()`, and `extract()`.
- In the main method, insert the values into the heap.
- Print the lowest value on the heap.
- Delete the lowest value from the heap.
- Delete the highest value from the heap.
- Print the heap.     
``` java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    }

}
```
