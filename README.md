# Heap project

### Objective
The project's main focus is understanding heap.

### Problem
Create a Scoreboard as a heap.

### Implementation
- Create a min-heap class of `score` called `scoreboard` with the following operations: `insert()`, `delete()`, `peek()`, and `extract()`.
- In the main method, insert 5 objects from the [`score`](https://github.com/SAFCSP-Team/heap-project/blob/main/src/score.java) class into the heap.
- Print the points of the highest ranked on the heap.
- Delete the information of the highest ranked from the heap.
- Delete the information of the lowest ranked from the heap.
- Print the heap.    
``` java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    }

}
```
