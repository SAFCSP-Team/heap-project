# Heap project

### Objective
The project's main focus is understanding heap.

### Problem
Create a min-heap class of integers called `MinHeap`.

### Implementation
- Create a min-heap class of integers called `MinHeap` with the following operations: `insert()`, `delete()`, `peek()`, and `extract()`.
- In the main method, insert values into the heap.
- Print the lowest value on the heap.
- Delete the lowest value from the heap.
- Delete the highest value from the heap.
- Print the heap.
